## @version 2021-02-18

## @brief this is a program that asks the user to input number of students,
## and the age of the students. It will then spit out the total age in
## years, lowest age in years, highest age in years, number of students
## with even number age, number of students with odd number age, the
## average of the even and odd ages, the average age in years,
## and the average age in days.

## @note this program took 5 hours to develop, write, test, and debug

#ask for number of students, if number of students is not positive
#then give an error message.

#assign our variables, and have the program calculate
