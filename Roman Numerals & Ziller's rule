## @brief This program contains 2 parts.
## The first section consists of a program that 
## prompts the user for their name, and a number between 1 - 10
## and outputs the roman numeral associated with that integer.
## an error message will occur if the number is not between 1 - 10
## The second program that asks the user to input the year, month and
## number date to calculate the day of the week using Ziller's rule
## error messages will occur if the day of the month/year is too big or small

## @note This code took me 4 hours to develop, write, test, and debug
## My biggest issue was a simple syntax error that took 2 hours to
## find and fix lol
